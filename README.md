gulp-kickstart
==============

A mini framework for quickly starting web projects. Itâ€™s built around [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/), features live reloading capability for fast CSS and JavaScript development, and uses the CSS categorization approach introduced by [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/).

## What is this good for?

You can

* quickly start a web project with only a few commands
* see how [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) works and how simple it is to work with
* edit and tweak the code and settings to exactly fit your needs (actually I encourage you to do so)
* instantly see the results of your CSS and JavaScript without having to manually reload the browser

## Prerequirements

For using the mini framework you have to have installed

* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

on your system.
